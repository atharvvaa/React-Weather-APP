# React-Weather-APP
A responsive and user-friendly weather application built with React.js that allows users to search for current weather conditions in any city worldwide.
The app fetches real-time weather data from a public API OpenWeatherMap, displaying key information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with dynamic icons and backgrounds. It features modern UI/UX design, error handling for invalid searches, and optional features like geolocation-based weather, unit conversion (°C/°F), and forecast display.
